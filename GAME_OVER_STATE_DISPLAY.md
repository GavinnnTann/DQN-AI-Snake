# Game Over State Display Feature

## Overview
When the game ends, a comprehensive final game state is printed to the terminal, allowing you to see exactly what happened at the moment of death - even while the game over overlay is displayed on screen.

## Feature Description

### What's Displayed

When the game ends, the terminal will show:

#### 1. **Basic Game Information**
- Game mode (Manual, A*, Dijkstra, Q-Learning, or DQN)
- Final score
- Snake length
- Number of food items eaten

#### 2. **Position Details**
- Snake head position (x, y coordinates)
- Current direction (with arrow symbol)
- Food position
- Distance to food (Manhattan distance)

#### 3. **Cause of Death Analysis**
- **Wall Collision**: Shows which wall was hit (left/right/top/bottom) with exact coordinates
- **Self Collision**: Shows which body segment was hit and its position in the snake

#### 4. **DQN Agent Debug Info** (DQN mode only)
- Last action taken (Turn Right, Straight, Turn Left)
- Q-values for all actions at the moment of death
- State perception (danger detection in each direction)

#### 5. **Snake Body Visualization**
- For snakes ≤10 segments: Full body listing
- For snakes >10 segments: First 5 + last 5 segments (middle omitted for readability)
- Each segment labeled with position number

      Straight: 3.1234
      Turn Left: 1.8765
   State at Death:
      Danger - Straight: True
      Danger - Right: False
      Danger - Left: False

🐍 Snake Body (24 segments):
   [HEAD] (19, 14)
   [#1] (19, 13)
   [#2] (19, 12)
   [#3] (18, 12)
   [#4] (17, 12)
   ... (14 segments omitted) ...
   [#19] (9, 8)
   [#20] (9, 7)
   [#21] (8, 7)
   [#22] (8, 8)
   [#23] (8, 9)
============================================================
```

### Wall Collision Example
```
💀 Cause of Death:
   - Hit wall at boundary
   - Right wall (x=20)
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `advanced_snake/main.py`:
  - Added `print_final_game_state()` method (Line ~215-310)
  - Added `direction_to_string()` helper method (Line ~312-322)
  - Modified game over detection to call print method (Line ~435)

### Key Methods

#### `print_final_game_state()`
Main method that prints comprehensive game state information to terminal.

**Features:**
- Analyzes collision type (wall vs body)
- Calculates derived statistics (distance, segments eaten)
- Formats output with clear sections and symbols
- Includes DQN-specific debug info when applicable
- Handles long snakes with smart truncation

#### `direction_to_string(direction)`
Helper method to convert direction tuples to readable strings with arrow symbols.

**Returns:**
- `UP` → "UP ↑"
- `DOWN` → "DOWN ↓"
- `LEFT` → "LEFT ←"
- `RIGHT` → "RIGHT →"

## Usage

1. **Play the game normally** (any mode)
2. **When the game ends**, check your terminal
3. **Review the detailed state output** while the game over overlay is on screen
4. **Press ENTER or ESC** to return to menu

## Benefits

✅ **Post-Mortem Analysis**: See exactly what went wrong  
✅ **DQN Debugging**: Understand agent decisions at critical moments  
✅ **Training Insights**: Identify patterns in agent failures  
✅ **No Screen Obstruction**: Terminal output doesn't interfere with game visuals  
✅ **Permanent Record**: Terminal output can be scrolled back and reviewed  
✅ **Detailed Context**: More information than can fit on game screen  

## Use Cases

### 1. **Manual Play**
- Understand why you died
- Review your snake's path
- See how close you were to the food

### 2. **DQN Training Analysis**
- Check agent's Q-value predictions at death
- Identify if agent saw the danger
- Understand decision-making process

### 3. **Algorithm Comparison**
- Compare different modes' performance
- Analyze failure patterns
- Debug pathfinding issues

### 4. **High Score Attempts**
- Review what went wrong on promising runs
- Understand late-game mistakes
- Learn from near-misses

## Technical Notes

### Snake Body Truncation Logic
```python
if len(snake) <= 10:
    # Show all segments
else:
    # Show first 5 + last 5
    # Omit middle segments for readability
```

### Collision Detection
- **Wall**: Checks if head coordinates are outside grid bounds
- **Body**: Checks if head position matches any body segment (index 1 onwards)
- Reports exact collision location and segment number

### DQN State Capture
- Uses existing debug variables (`last_q_values`, `last_action`, `last_state_summary`)
- Only shown when in DQN mode and agent is loaded
- Provides insight into agent's final decision

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Save detailed state to log file
- Export game replay data
- Generate ASCII art visualization of final board state
- Add statistical analysis over multiple games
- Compare final state to optimal solution

## Related Features

- **Debug Mode** (Press 'G'): Real-time overlay during gameplay
- **Highscore System**: Automatic tracking and saving
- **Game Over Screen**: Visual overlay with score display

This feature complements the existing debug mode by providing detailed post-game analysis in the terminal.
